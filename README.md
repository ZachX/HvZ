Welcome to Critical Mass!
===================


Hey! Critical Mass is an Android application that helps you see where most people around you are! When you open Critical Mass, you can see events around your location. A “event” suggests that a certain number of users is in the same location. If you want to see more information about a mass, you can either click on the event or switch to the list layout.
